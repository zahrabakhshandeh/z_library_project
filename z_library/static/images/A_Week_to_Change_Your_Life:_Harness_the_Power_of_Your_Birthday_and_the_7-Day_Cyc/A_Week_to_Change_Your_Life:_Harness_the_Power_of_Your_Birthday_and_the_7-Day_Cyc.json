Do you regularly get the Monday Blues? Are you always tired on Fridays, even though you want to be excited for the weekend? There may be more to it than just a long work week. Over the course of a week, the human body goes through a cycle of self-regulation. Our energy levels, inflammation levels, capacity to focus, and even our immunity all fluctuate naturally based on this internal seven-day cycle, scientifically known as the circaseptan rhythm. Now, Dr. Olivia Audrey reveals how we can tap into the power of this seven-day cycle to transform our health and overhaul our mind and mood. The key to understanding your own circaseptan rhythm, remarkably, from the day of the week on which you were born. The birth experience is like a hormonal storm that inflames the body, one that is repeated week after week with an ebb and flow of inflammation and repair that lasts seven days. This cycle has a measurable impact on mood, energy, and all facets of physical health. Dr. Audrey’s protocol provides a set of instructions for how to align your health goals with your body’s natural circaseptan rhythm, unlocking extraordinary benefits. With her accessible writing and actionable advice, Dr. Audrey reveals the secret to harnessing your body’s natural rhythms in order to heal whatever ails you and boost how you look, feel, and live. This plan is effective for losing weight, gaining focus, fighting specific diseases, or simply feeling more in tune with your life. A Week to Change Your Life is the ultimate program to help you create a life of radiant health and energy.",
