    "desc": "A New Yorker contributor and co-founder of RAW traces the creative process that went into his Pulitzer Prize-winning classic, revealing the inspirations for his work while providing on an accompanying DVD a reference copy of The Complete Maus and audio interviews with his father.In the pages of MetaMaus, Art Spiegelman re-enters the Pulitzer prize-winning Maus, the modern classic that has altered how we see literature, comics, and the Holocaust ever since it was first published twenty-five years ago.  Does he probe the questions that Maus most often evokes — Why the Holocaust? Why mice? Why comics?— and gives us a new and essential work about the creative process.MetaMaus includes a bonus DVD-R that provides a digitized reference copy of The Complete Maus linked to a deep archive of audio interviews with his survivor father, historical documents, and a wealth of Spiegelman’s private notebooks and sketches.Compelling and intimate, MetaMaus is poised to become a classic in its own right.",
