In the introduction to the book, which is beautifully illustrated with colour photographs throughout, you have all the information you need about the essential ingredients (and not just soya), kitchen utensils and the various fermentation starters that are available, how to make them yourself, which other ingredients are helpful and above all where you get them. You will find all sources listed. There are basic recipes, such as cashew cheese, on which other recipes then build and a whole range of vegan 'milk classics' to make. Vegan cheese, yogurt, tofu, milk, cream and butter are surprisingly diverse and easy to prepare. The wealth of recipes spans the spectrum from tomato rosemary cheese made from almonds, fermented by Rejuvelac and herbal cream cheese from coconut cream, almond crème fraîche to chickpea tofu. There is even a recipe for cheese dip for nachos, and mac-and-cheese. In addition to the cheeses you will find plenty of spreads, butters with different flavours and full-bodied delicacies such as ricotta or mascarpone. And there are faster variants such as the 'pizza cheese'. Finally there is a chapter covering vegan drinks such as almond milk, oat drink, quick nut milk with nutmeg and soy milk. So who needs to buy drinks in the supermarket when you can make them much healthier and cheaper yourself? You'll be surprised how little effort vegan products take to make at home. Once again proof that the vegan diet is quite versatile.",
